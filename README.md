## My process

I started by looked at designs to see what should it look like. After that I added the tags in index.html to have the layout of the card. From there I started the trial and error process of my css to make it look as close to the design as I could. Nothing in particularly very difficult and I'm happy about the result. I don't think is perfect in anyway and I'm sure there is a better way, but for now I'm proud.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this practice project I learned how to responsivly load images, based on the viewport of the window using

```html

```
